[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mlogmsg  [22mprints  error,  warning, or info/logging messages to stderr and
       potentially terminates the calling  program,  depending  on  the  [4mclass[0m
       given.   [4mwho[24m  is the name of the program, [4mecode[24m is an error code, [4mclass[0m
       determines the behavior upon call and [4mmsg[24m is the logging message.  Read
       "error.h" to learn more about related constants.

[1mECODE[0m
       [4mecode[24m is the error code and subject to be displayed in the log file and
       potentially used upon exit if the [4mclass[24m equals [1mERROR[22m, [1mFATAL[22m, or [1mDROP[22m.

       To avoid conflicts with syscall error codes, appplication defined error
       codes  should  be negative.  The values [4m-15[24m, [4m-100[24m and [4m-111[24m are reserved
       for backward compatibility.

       [1mINFO[22m,  [1mALERT[22m, [1mWARN[22m, [1mDROP[22m, [1mUSAGE[22m, and [1mFATAL [22mas well as [1mERROR [22mdisplay the
       respective class string like [4mwarning:[24m in the  log  message,  while  [1mLOG[0m
       shows the log message only.

       The  class [1mFATAL [22mshould be used for system error codes only, rather [1mER‚Äê[0m
       [1mROR [22mand [1mWARN [22mshall be  set  in  conjunction  with  an  application  er‚Äê
       ror/warning.

[1mMESSAGE[0m
       If the custom message [4mmsg[24m is given, it will be printed additionally.

       Dan  Bernstein  used sets of [4mstrerr_dieY*()[24m and [4mstrerr_warnY()[24m messages
       which explicitely determine the  message  and  behavior  class.   Other
       classes were occasionally defined on demand, such als [4musage()[24m.

       Kai  Peter introduced the [4merrmsg[24m facility in his [1mqlibs [22mincluding a [1msys‚Äê[0m
       [1mlog [22mcompliant [4mseverity[24m as second parameter.

[1mEXAMPLES[0m
       The macro definitions uses  [1mw [22mfor the  calling  program,  [1me  [22mfor  error
       code, [1mc [22mfor class, and [1mm [22mfor message.

         #include "logmsg.h"
         #define WHO "my_prog"

         err_sys(WHO,errno);
         err_sys_plus(WHO,-111,"additional message");

         err_tmp("",-100);
         err_tmp_plus("",errno,"additional message");

         log_who(WHO,"message");

       log_anon() is like log_who() but doesn't print the caller name.

       An user defined message [1ms [22mcan be build from multiple arguments by using
       the [4mB[24m (build) macro:

         err_sys_plus((errno),B("unable to run: ",*argv));
