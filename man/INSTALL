Imstallation of fehQlibs man pages
==================================

a) It is expected that the fehQlibs are installed at /usr/local.
b) Check your manpath settings: $ manpath
c) You might want to compress the manpages: gzip *.3
d) If available, the compressed or raw man pages can be simply copied to
   - /usr/local/man/man3 or
   - /usr/local/share/man/man3
   'root' is required to complete this step.

That's it!
